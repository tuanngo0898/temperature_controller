# Simple temperature PID control project
This is a project for Application Electronic cource at my university. The purpose of this project is to control temperature of a small heating block with a 12V/40W heater and 100k NTC thermistor. These components are used in a 3D printer at my laboratory.

# Usage 
The board is designed with Altium Designer

</p>

As we can see from above, there are 3 out of board components needed for this project:

* Heating block
* 12V/40V 3D rinter heater
* 100k Ohm NTC thermistor
